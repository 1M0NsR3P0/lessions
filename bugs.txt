the first bug happend now! 09/26/2023 5:42 (now)
1. I have set a toggle button, when i click it this will change the src attribute of the button svg
2. Everything was okay! i asked chatGPT to see what's wrong. But it was not a coding error!
no erorr shows in the console.
3. Then I just did some debugging my own but still the problem happens
4. Ohh! The problem was when i click on the card button the src was not changing for the first time, after the
second time i click it works just fine.
5. Then I console Out at every line to see which line is being ignored. The browser debbuger cannot shows the bug  because it seems like Everything is okay!
6. Then i noticed that the console say the value of the toggle is false for first click, and then on second click
it toggle to true and the src changes.
7. The problem was setting the initial toggle value is false. I just ignored it because, it doesn't matter when you
use toggle, the toggle fucntion just make it the oposite of it's initial value. so whether it is false of true the 
the toggle funciton make it toggle.
8. My thinking of that ignored value was wrong. that is what i realized.
for details see the part of the toggle funciton 

// this is the toggle fucntion
const buttonToggle = document.querySelectorAll(".btn[cardButton]");
        buttonToggle.forEach((button, i) => {
            const src = document.querySelectorAll(".btn[cardButton] img");
            let toggle = true 
            // first i did the initial value to false. that why the bug happened. interesting. isn't it?
            button.addEventListener('click', () => {
                console.log(toggle)
                toggle = !toggle;
                if (toggle) {
                    src[i].setAttribute('src', "./add-to-cart-icon.svg")
                } else {
                    src[i].setAttribute('src', "./shopping-bag-checkmark-icon.svg")
                }
            })
        })
